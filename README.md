The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.
It is being used to build [`Gaia`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/overview.md).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the [SDK Application Tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/nameservice/tutorial/00-intro.html). You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/).

## Cosmos Hub Mainnet

The Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.

## Interblockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the SDK has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

## Starport

If you are starting a new app or a new module you can use [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) to help you get started and speed up development. If you have any questions or find a bug, feel free to open an issue in the repo.

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.

## Changes to Cudos fork of cosmos-sdk

Below are described the changes that Cudos have implemented to the cosmos-sdk for the purpose of Cudos Network.

### MinSelfDelegation minimum value 2000000000000000000000000

When validator is created there is a setting being set about the minimum self delegation amount required for the validator to be operational. For Cudos Network this is required to be at least 2M CUDOS. This is achieved with a check in the `CreateValidator` function in staking module's `msg_server.go`. Also we've added a check in the standard `ValdiateBasic` function for `MsgCreateValidator`.

There is also an additional error type added in `types/errors.go`.

The majority of changes are for the tests. Since we now require validators to have that setting, we also have to rise the actual self delegation they put on themselves. From there we have to give the addresses more funds, the calculated rewards are different and so on. That makes it so many changes in the tests are required just for this small setting change.

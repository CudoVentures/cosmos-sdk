The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in Golang.
It is being used to build [`Gaia`](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia), the first implementation of the Cosmos Hub.

**WARNING**: The SDK has mostly stabilized, but we are still making some
breaking changes.

**Note**: Requires [Go 1.15+](https://golang.org/dl/)

## Quick Start

To learn how the SDK works from a high-level perspective, go to the [SDK Intro](./docs/intro/overview.md).

If you want to get started quickly and learn how to build on top of the SDK, please follow the [SDK Application Tutorial](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/nameservice/tutorial/00-intro.html). You can also fork the tutorial's repository to get started building your own Cosmos SDK application.

For more, please go to the [Cosmos SDK Docs](./docs/).

## Cosmos Hub Mainnet

The Cosmos Hub application, `gaia`, has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/gaia). Go there to join the Cosmos Hub mainnet and more.

## Interblockchain Communication (IBC)

The IBC module for the SDK has moved to its [own repository](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go). Go there to build and integrate with the IBC module.

## Starport

If you are starting a new app or a new module you can use [Starport](https://github.com/tendermint/starport) to help you get started and speed up development. If you have any questions or find a bug, feel free to open an issue in the repo.

## Disambiguation

This Cosmos-SDK project is not related to the [React-Cosmos](https://github.com/react-cosmos/react-cosmos) project (yet). Many thanks to Evan Coury and Ovidiu (@skidding) for this Github organization name. As per our agreement, this disambiguation notice will stay here.

## Changes to Cudos fork of cosmos-sdk

Below are described the changes that Cudos have implemented to the cosmos-sdk for the purpose of Cudos Network.

### Burned tokens to community pool

In the original cosmos-sdk there are several cases where tokens are being burned. We can separate them into two categories - staking coins burns and vouches (ibc denom tokens, Gravity Bridge denoms) burns. The vouches are being burned for the purpose of not going over the cap when transferring them back and forth. The staking coin's burns are more of a deflation mechanic.

In Cudos Network the burned staking coins (acudos) are sent to the community pool and the burn mechanic for the vouchers is left as it is.

This is achieved by changing the `BurnCoins` function in bank module's keeper. It is being called anywhere there is burning of coins, so it is a central place where we can implement the change with a single fix. 

For it to work the app's distribution keeper should be passed to the bank keeper. Because of this we've added a check in the `BurnCoins` function to check this. There is also another check for the denom of the coins being burned - if it is `acudos`, transfer them to the community pool, if it is any other - use the old logic to burn them.

There is also a new test added to check this functionality and a log anytime burn or transfer to community pool is done.
